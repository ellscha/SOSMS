# SOSMS / Message-SOS
I hate having to rely on my friends or family being near a phone when I am in an uncomfortable situation. I created SOSMS for exactly this reason.
1. Find a reason to excuse yourself... go to the bathroom or over to the bar.
2. take out your phone and open up SOSMS.
3. ![HowTOImage](https://github.com/ellscha/SOSMS/blob/master/Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20-%20iPhone%2011%20Pro%20Max%20-%202020-03-12%20at%2022.02.09.png)
4. Go to your home screen and in two minutes you'll receive the first of 3 SOSMSs.
5. Find your way back to the table (before the messages send).
6. GTFO! Apologize and then do what you need to do! Be Safe!

*Fun Fact: ICE stands for In Case of Emergency*
