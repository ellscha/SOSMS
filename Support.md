# SOSMS
I hate having to rely on my friends or family being near a phone when I am in an uncomfortable situation. I created SOSMS for exactly this reason.
1. Find a reason to excuse yourself... go to the bathroom or over to the bar.
2. take out your phone and open up SOSMS.
3. ![HowTOImage](https://github.com/ellscha/SOSMS/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-02-18%20at%2010.59.56%20PM.png)
4. Go to your home screen and in two minutes you'll receive the first of 3 SOSMSs.
5. Find your way back to the table (before the messages send).
6. GTFO! Apologize and then do what you need to do! Be Safe!


When the message comes through, it'll look something like this:
